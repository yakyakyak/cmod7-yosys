# Build Directory

This directory contains generated build artifacts. All files here are automatically generated by the build process and are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## Generated Files

### FPGA Build Outputs
- `blinky.json` - Synthesized netlist from Yosys (9.1 MB)
- `blinky.fasm` - FPGA assembly from NextPNR (23 KB)
- `blinky.frames` - Frame data from fasm2frames (5.3 MB)
- `blinky.bit` - Final bitstream ready for programming (2.1 MB)
- `xc7a35tcpg236-1.bin` - Device chipdb cached for faster builds (88 MB)

### Simulation Outputs
- `tb_top_quick.vcd` - Quick simulation waveform (4.2 MB)
- `tb_top.vcd` - Full simulation waveform
- `*.vvp` - Compiled Verilog simulation executables

## Chipdb Cache

The chipdb file (`xc7a35tcpg236-1.bin`) is cached here to avoid regenerating it on every build (takes 2-3 minutes to generate). This file is device-specific and can be deleted if you need to force regeneration.

## Cleaning

To clean build artifacts:
```bash
# Remove build outputs but keep chipdb
make clean

# Remove everything including chipdb
make clean-all

# Remove only simulation outputs
make clean-sim
```
